An activity for introducing programmers to programming with generative AI

copyright 2023, Chris Minnick

## Description

In this activity, you'll work as a team, and with a generative AI tool, to create a trivia game.

## Requirements

1. Each team, and preferably each member of each team, should have access to a generative AI tool such as ChatGPT or Copilot.
2. Each team should have access to a code editor such as VS Code.
3. Each team should have access to a GitHub account.
4. Each participant should have access to this GitHub repository.
5. Each team should have access to a web browser.
6. Participants should have familiarity with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Organize your team

1. Each team should create a new GitHub repository for their trivia game.
2. Each team member should clone the repository to their local computer. The owner of the repository should give each team member write access to the repository.
3. As a team, decide on roles for each team member. More than one team member can have the same role. Roles might include:
   - Project Manager
   - Writer
   - Designer
   - Programmer
   - QA
4. As a team, decide on a topic (or multiple topics) for your trivia game. Use ChatGPT or Copilot to generate ideas for topics.
5. As a team, decide on a name for your trivia game. Use ChatGPT or Copilot to generate ideas for names.

### Part 2: Create the game content

In this part, you'll use your generative AI tool to create the content for your trivia game.

1. Use your generative AI tool to create the content for your trivia game. For example, if your trivia game is about the history of the United States, you might use your generative AI tool to create questions and answers about the history of the United States. Think about what format the questions and answers should be in (or ask your generative AI tool for recommendations) so they can be used programmatically.
2. Copy the content from your generative AI tool into a file in your GitHub repository.
3. As a team, review the content and make any necessary changes.

### Part 3: Create the game

In this part, you'll use your code editor to create the game.

1. As a team, decide on the rules for your trivia game. Use ChatGPT or Copilot to generate ideas for rules.
2. As a team, decide on the format for your trivia game. For example, will it be a web page? A mobile app? A voice app? Use ChatGPT or Copilot to generate ideas for formats.
3. Figure out how to use your generative AI tool to create the code for your trivia game. For example, if your trivia game is a web page, you might use your generative AI tool to create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web page.
4. Copy the code from your generative AI tool into the appropriate files in your GitHub repository.
5. As a team, review the code and make any necessary changes.

### Part 4: Test the game

In this part, you'll create a test plan and test your game.

1. As a team, create a test plan for your trivia game. Use ChatGPT or Copilot to generate ideas for test plans.
2. As a team, test your trivia game. Use ChatGPT or Copilot to generate ideas for test cases.
3. As a team, review the test results and make any necessary changes.

### Part 5: Publish the game

In this part, you'll publish your game.

1. As a team, decide on a way to publish your trivia game. For example, you might publish it as a web page, a mobile app, or a voice app. Use ChatGPT or Copilot to generate ideas for ways to publish your game.
2. Publish your trivia game.
